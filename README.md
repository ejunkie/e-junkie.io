> If you are running in in your local system, its better to have Host entry in your local server, e.g, instead of having http://localhost/, you can have a host entry in your vhosts with domain name same as your website (abc.com, xyz.def, github.io). Otherwise when uploading to your server you have to edit website.json, Users/`username`.json manually.
